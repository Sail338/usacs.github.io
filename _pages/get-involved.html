    <p>One of its fastest growing and most successful initiatives, the USACS mentoring program offers the opportunity
      for personal and professional growth to members of all ages and skill levels. Some of our current mentors
      specialize in web development, game creation, and CS fundamentals.
    </p>
    <p>Relationships with mentees can range anywhere from daily tutoring to networking help and even just occasional
      advice for course planning - whatever works best for participants. Says mentee SaraAnn Stanway “Participation in
      the mentor program was the catalyst for my involvement in CS. My mentor made sure that I was never intimidated at
      how much there was to learn, and has become a great friend and role model in the process.”
